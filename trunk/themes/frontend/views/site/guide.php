			<h3>Is it safe to use Instagress? Yes, if you do it correctly.</h3>
			<p>
				The best and most natural way to attract attention to your
				Instagram account is to interact with other users. But what
				if you can't give this all your time?
			</p>
			<p>
				That's why we have created Instagress — a service that automates
				your Instagram activity and works even when you are sleeping.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you follow our recommendations, the use of our service will
				be completely safe for you!
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-right guide-2">
			<h3>Before you start:</h3>
			<p>
				1. Make sure that e-mail, which you used for registration in
				Instagram is real, and you have access to it.

				This is important in case if Instagram will suspect unusual
				activity on your account and forcibly change your password.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Upload avatar and fill in your profile.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Add at least 5 photos to your account.

				If your account has only one picture, but you are very active — you
				are more likely to be blocked. This account can be regarded as robot.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. Add photos regularly.

				The more alive your account looks — the more likes and comments you can get.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. Ensure that your content does not violate the rules of Instagram.
				We are not responsible for your actions and their consequences.
			</p>

		<h2>How to choose settings?</h2>

		<div class="guide-text-right guide-settings-1">
			<h4>1. Actions</h4>
			<p>
				Select what do you want to do: like, comment, follow or unfollow.
			</p>
			<p>
				To do this, press on the button next to each action, so its color
				changes to red.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can't follow and unfollow at the same time. All other operations
				may be enabled simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>
				We strongly recommend you not to like, comment follow or unfollow from
				your phone, as well as use other bots simultaneously with Instagress.
				Instagram limits are very strict and you can not get around them.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can upload new pictures without stopping bot.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-left guide-settings-3">
			<h4>2. Activity speed</h4>
			<p>
				We recommend to use Normal.
			</p>
			<p>
				This setting controls how quickly you spend your Instagram limits.
				When creating speeds we tried to recreate real activity — such as
				if you are doing it on your own phone.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are constantly making improvements in speed settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Try to not have liking, commenting and following activity on your
				phone during your activity is started on Instagress.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-right guide-settings-2">
			<h4>3. Media source</h4>
			<p>
				Select the source from which will take photos or videos:
			</p>
			<p>
				● Tags — you interact with new users whose photos or videos are
				selected from the tags that you specify.
			</p>
			<p>
				● My Feed — you interact with photos or videos of the users you
				already follow. It is very convenient in case if you do not
				have time put likes to your friends! By selecting this option you
				can not follow, as well as settings of "Tags" will be unavailable.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-left guide-settings-4">
			<h4>4. Minimum likes filter & Maximum likes filter</h4>
			<p>
				We have created this setting, in order that you can be sure that you
				like or comment only popular photos or videos, if it is important for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you put Min. likes: 10 and Max. likes: 0, you will like or comment
				photos/videos that already have 10 likes or more.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to be one of the first who puts a like or comment — put these
				settings: Min. likes: 0, Max. likes: 10.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you put Min. likes: 0, Max. likes: 0 — filtering will be removed.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-right guide-settings-5">
			<h4>5. New media only</h4>
			<p>
				Select "New media only" if you want to interact only with new photos
				or videos that recently appeared in tags that you specify.
			</p>
			<p>
				If tags that you choose not very popular this process can take a little bit
				more time. Because new photos and videos will appear with the long time interval.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also recommend you not to use high numbers in "Min. likes" and "Max. likes"
				settings because it takes time to get likes for new media. Try to use Min. likes: 0
				and Max. likes: 10 to achieve the maximum results.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-left guide-settings-unfollow">
			<h4>6. Unfollow source & Unfollow who don't follow me:</h4>
			<p>
				Select the source from which will unfollow users:
			</p>
			<p>
				● Instagress — you will unfollow only users which were followed only by our service.
			</p>
			<p>
				● All — you will unfollow all users which you follow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Select "Unfollow who don't follow me" if you want to unfollow users only who don't
				follow you back. You can use it with "Instagress" or "All" source.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember that you can't follow and unfollow at the same time. You can choose only
				one action.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-right guide-settings-dontcomment">
			<h4>7. Don't comment same users</h4>
			<p>
				This setting will not allow you to comment more than one photo or video of the same user.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, you can find it useful if your comments contain advertising and you do not
				want to look intrusive. Or you just do not want to spend your comments to the same user twice.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-left guide-settings-6">
			<h4>8. Tags</h4>
			<p>
				We recommend using at least 10 tags.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you choose tags of a specific topic — you target your activity.
				This helps to attract the attention of those people who are really
				interested in your account.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if you are photographing nature, interact with the people
				who are interested in same. Or if you have a women's clothing shop in
				Barcelona, ​​be sure to add tags such as: #spain #barcelona #girls. This
				will help you attract more customers and fans.
			</p>
			<p>
				Try to use popular tags. The less popular tag, the slower your
				activity. This is due to the fact that new photos with such tags
				appear less frequently.
			</p>
			<p>
				To delete all tags — click on the arrow next to the Add button.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-right guide-settings-7">
			<h4>9. Comments</h4>
			<p>
				You can use comments, we have added for you or write your own.
				We recommend using at least 10 different neutral comments like:
				Nice, Like it, Beautiful, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you leave spam comments — your account may be suspended.
				For such purposes, we recommend to use additional accounts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Photos are commented only once. Our system remembers photos that
				you have already commented.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use an unlimited number of comments. For each photo or
				video comment is selected randomly.
			</p>
			<p>
				To delete all the comments — click on the arrow next to the Add button.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-left guide-settings-8">
			<h4>10. Like, Comment, Follow and Unfollow counters</h4>
			<p>
				If you want to control how many actions you make during the day — this options
				is for you. When selected number of actions will be done your activity will be
				stopped automatically.
			</p>
			<p>
				We recommend to make not more than 1000 likes, 250 comments, 300 follows and
				150 unfollows for 24 hour. Set zero for no limit.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-text-right guide-settings-9">
			<h4>11. Timer</h4>
			<p>
				This setting works as a timer — your Activity will be stopped once specified
				amount of time will pass.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, put 02:00 and your activity will turn off after 2 hours.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="guide-footnote">
			<p>
				We're monitoring work of our service every day and always try to be
				informed about all changes in the work of Instagram.
